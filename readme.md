*Built for the 2025 Spooky Jam*

Do you think you are safe ? Imagine : you are walking in your villages, built with your friends, without any problems... wait, is this house open ? Like i'm a good citizen I will close it !

**BUT MISTAKES !!!**

You just stepped on the house's porch and **BOOM** ! A creeper jumpscare you ! What a prank !

## How to prank ?

First, craft a jumpscare scroll with 2 `Paper`, `Red Dye` and an `Ink Sac`.

Then craft a jumpscare workbench with a `Jumpscare Scroll`, a `Crafting Table` and a `Feather`.

Then, set your jumpscare on your scroll and right click a block to set the jumpscare !

The jumpscare will trigger if a player walk on it or delete the block.
